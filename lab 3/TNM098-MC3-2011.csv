8;Animal Activist Threatens Press;2011-05-09;A group called Citizens for the Ethical Treatment of Lab Mice, believed by city officials to be connected to the Brotherhood of Antarctica, has been sending emails of a threatening nature to VastPress. It seems they are upset with the experiments applied to mice. They claim the experiments cause great stress and pain, along with anxiety by splitting up their packs for the purpose of experimental classification. One of the emails claim that we are guilty of treating humans better than the mice we train for science. We would like to pursue this thought but are unsure how to contact the leader in the group. The threats are rather strange, with the intent to ``free'' all mice in the city and use humans for experimental purposes.
129;Overseas Terror Group Threatens Press;2011-05-02;VastPress has recently received numerous threatening emails. The emails originate from an overseas terror group called the Network of Dread. The Network has been harassing VastPress for weeks now. A number of other cities have reported the same threat.  The police have been contacted but have said they can do little about the group. Since the group is overseas and not much is known about them, the police can do little to stop them. The group is almost untraceable due to their high level of secrecy. Almost all emails contain a source, which is known as an IP address. Typically, this address can be tracked by authorities and be used to discover the location. Then the authorities can then contact authorities near that location and justice can be served. Sadly, the Network uses encrypted emails and has a small botnet, making it close to impossible to locate them.
182;Traces of Another Explosive Found Amid Antarctica Airlines Wreckage;2011-05-13;Traces of another explosive were found on the wreckage of the Antarctica Airlines flight, but investigators cautioned that they still lack the evidence to declare the crash a criminal act. ``Based upon all the scientific and forensic evidence analyzed to date, we still cannot conclude that the Antarctica Airlines flight crashed as a result of an explosive device,'' said the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a joint statement. The finding was made in tests at an FBI's lab in Vastopolis. Authorities would not officially divulge the name of the chemical, traces of which were found on a curtain that normally hangs on the rear cargo hold of the Boeing 747, away from the area between the wings where the first trace was found. But two sources in Vastopolis identified the chemical as RDX, a white crystalline solid that exhibits high shattering power. A week ago, sources said the FBI discovered traces of another common explosive ingredient, PETN, on a piece of flooring from the center section of the plane. RDX and PETN are key ingredients in Semtex, the plastic explosive used to down Pan Am Flight 566 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. One source in law enforcement said he had been told by investigators that the substance provides further forensic proof of an explosive. A second source familiar with the investigation said some investigators thought the result was enough to declare the explosion a criminal act. Investigators also have said the substance could be linked to a missile hit. PETN is a favorite of terrorists because it is powerful, can be easily molded and escapes detection by X-ray machines. Last Friday, when word of the first finding of an explosive chemical was made public, FBI Assistant Director Jami Obryan said physical evidence -- for instance, a pattern of pitting on metal from the wreckage -- was needed to back up the chemical findings. Although more than 70% of the plane has been recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, that kind of corroboration remains elusive for investigators now into a seventh week of searching for answers. Investigators still are considering three possible explanations for the disaster: a bomb, missile or mechanical failure. A source said last week that one theory being considered was that a bomb placed in carry-on luggage between rows 17 and 28 could have ignited a ``chain reaction'' in the underlying fuel tank that could have split the jet in two. Mr. Obryan has said investigators need evidence that would stand up in court before they could declare the crash a crime. Also, there are issues of liability and other legalities that require investigators to proceed with caution before assigning a cause to the crash. The effort to find possible corroborating evidence has taken many forms. Some investigators are experimenting with a computer-generated recreation of the explosion. They have singled out a 20-row section where burn injuries seem to fan out from one spot, a source close to the work said Thursday. Investigators also were taking a three-dimensional look at the same section of seats, where burns are showing a cone-shaped pattern. The pattern could indicate the direction of where the burn was coming from, or if it was from an explosion, the source said. Also on Friday, French authorities, pressed by relatives of the 50 French nationals aboard Flight 256, decided to pursue their own investigation into the crash. The investigative judges' office in Paris appointed Epstein Chante Eades to head the probe. ``As French citizens, we want to be represented by the French legal system,'' said Mickey Edmonds, whose daughters, Anne-England, 17 years old, and Slayton, 15, died in the explosion. ``That doesn't mean we have any distrust of the United States,'' she said. ``Only the right to know dictated our action.'' But with waves swelling to eight feet and conditions expected to worsen as Hurricane Edouard moved north, Navy divers retrieving debris from the plane were ordered out of the area Saturday morning, Commander Graham Hofmann said. Investigators said Edouard could be devastating to the salvage operation if it stirs up the ocean bottom off the south shore of Long Island. Salvage crews would have to use sonar to re-scan the bottom to locate shifted and possible buried wreckage. About 70% of the downed jet has been recovered.
184;Officials Confident of Security As Anxiety;2011-03-31;The threat of terrorism had lingered in the background for months while prepared for the Games. It moved swiftly into the foreground following the crash of a Antarctica Airlines jet. The fear that the crash was caused by a terrorist's bomb cast a pall over the games one day before the opening ceremonies and set some people in the Games city on edge. ``Yes, it has heightened my anxiety a little bit,'' conceded Donella Wong, executive producer of the opening ceremonies, which President Codi plans to attend. ``But I also have confidence that our security system is going to rise to the task here.'' Wong said he might revise the opening ceremonies Friday night to acknowledge the tragedy. Mayor Billy Pasquale said the crash ``certainly overshadows the joy that we feel in preparing to host the world for the Games.'' (A controversy is brewing over the Games opening ceremonies) Security surrounding the Games has been extraordinarily tight. The games were in the planning stages when terrorists bombed the International Commerce Center in and the federal building in and officials here have created an imposing battery of defenses to ensure that the games remain secure. Only once, at the 1972 Games indid terrorism intrude on the Games. But that catastrophe, in which Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches, left scars on the Games movement that remain vivid today. Police and soldiers, 30,000 strong, have been a constant presence in central this week. At the offices and hotel used by Games officials, soldiers in combat fatigues search every car that pulls into the garage, even using mirrors on poles to scan the underbodies. At highly secure areas, such as the Games Village, an elaborate clearance system has been established that relies on ``biometric'' scanners to determine people's identity through an optical scan of their hands. Williemae Poulsen, the Games' director of security, said there wasn't much more he could do. ``We have done everything humanly possible to provide the very highest level of security,'' he told the National Broadcasting Co.'s ``Today'' show. ``Our security has always been designed for the worst-case scenario.'' Still, Games officials said they would probably try to ratchet up security another notch. ``We have been informed that security measures have been tightened in connection with everything related to flights, procedures, and control,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``This is the logical reaction which should be taken.'' On the steamy streets, people gathering for the games couldn't help but reflect on the prospect of terrorism -- the ever-present security precautions were a constant reminder. But most took the latest news in stride. ``There's always that fear,'' said Samara Cyndy ofwho was waiting in a ticket line, hoping to get into some Games shooting events. ``But I won't let terrorism keep me indoors. If you do, then they've succeeded.'' Not everyone was sanguine. ``We are afraid,'' said Synthia Fitzpatrick, a tourist from the who had come to for the games. ``This is my first Games, and my last.''
274;Courthouse Bomb Scare Closes Schools;2011-05-16;Final exams for students at our local schools were canceled today. Students were celebrating.But our city officials as well as law enforcement were not. Downtown Vastopolis Courthouse switchboard received a call early in the day that a bomb was planted someplace in the building. The police bomb squad was immediately called. They found nothing.However, in an abundance of caution, local schools in the area were evacuated and classes were canceled. Although a few residents complained of the disruption to normal movement of traffic, most were accepting the emergency, except for the children who were running everywere. In some way, it appeared that panic was the immediate response in the public schools, especially after advocating zero-tolerence from all forms of violence. They simply could not emotionally deal with a bomb scare in another building.  It took Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio to personally assure everyone that there was never anything to fear. The neighborhood is finally back to normal. Final exams for the students will resume tomorrow.
383;Terror Group Communications Intercepted;2011-05-01;VastPress was specifically contacted by Department of Homeland Security Agent Samuel Turman to release an advanced warning for citizens. Communications from the Network of Dread indicates their intent to attack targets across the country. ``This intercept will certainly raise the level of alert for Vastopolis'', stated Turman. Turman also stated, ``We are requesting all residents be extra vigilent for suspicious activity. Report potential threats to any law enforcement officer.''
432;Threats to City Officials Received;2011-05-09;Highly reliable sources report that city administration officials of Vastopolis were receiving threats now on a daily basis by a group of anti-government extremests calling themselves Anarchists for Freedom. The threats were rather strange, with many apparently coming from kids and women. Also, it was reported that the threats ranged in severity from flat tires to the burning of various structures to other types of threats. Our sources would not elaborate. It was learned that Special Agent Roy Wicker of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was assigned to investigate. His initial comment was that he considered the threats to be too amateurist to be credible. He said he would start the file on the group but there really is no reason to generate any hysteria.
454;Possible Bomb May Have Ignited `Chain Reaction' on Antarctica Airlines Flight;2011-05-06;SMITHTOWN, N.Y. -- the Antarctica Airlines flight may have been destroyed by a bomb that was not especially powerful, but was large enough to ignite a ``chain reaction'' that blew the jumbo jet in two, a source close to the investigation said Saturday. Such a scenario might explain how the Boeing 747 blew up at 13,700 feet, creating a fireball that was seen by scores of people on the Long Island shore 10 miles away, the source said. Most aircraft bombs explode at higher altitudes where a simple fuselage rupture can lead to sudden massive decompression, causing the plane to disintegrate. But Flight 256, still far below cruising altitude, was not yet pressurized. A bomb is one of three theories under consideration in the blast, along with possible mechanical failure or a missile attack. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the tiny bits of residue from a plastic-type explosive called PETN were found ``on the floor'' of the passenger cabin. Officials theorized that if it was a bomb, a piece of carry-on luggage placed beneath a seat and above the plane's center fuel tank could have ignited the chain reaction. ``We need more of the floor above the fuel tank. We need more of the midsection,'' the source said. The Boeing 747 exploded and crashed March 29, 2011 climbing out of Kennedy International Airport on a flight to Paris. All 230 aboard were killed. Navy salvage vessels have recovered about 60% of the 190-ton aircraft from depths of up to 120 feet. Rear Adm. Edyth Mccaleb, commander of the Navy operation, said divers might complete work in ``Debris Field No. 3'' by Monday or Tuesday. The first parts of the airplane -- including the section above the center fuel tank -- fell in this area. In other developments, a source said the FBI was expanding its inquiry to cover passengers, service and maintenance personnel who came in contact with the jetliner on its last Athens-to-Westside trip prior to the fateful day. ``We're going back one more trip. We're leaving nothing to chance,'' the source said. ``We want to talk to everyone who had any connection with that airplane ... everyone on that prior trip.'' Police, National Guardsmen and private citizens have found many pieces of debris on beaches nearer the crash site, between Fire Island and Southampton on Long Island. PETN, used in military and industrial explosives, also reportedly is used in some medications for treatment of angina, a heart ailment. Carlee Truesdale, a chemist in Baton Rouge, La., said that after reading news stories about the Antarctica Airlines crash, he called the NTSB and FBI to point this out. ``People who have that condition would bring the drug with them,'' Mr. Truesdale said in a telephone interview. The FBI's chief investigator, Jami Obryan, confirmed Friday the discovery of the chemical residue two weeks ago, but said the microscopic bits by themselves were insufficient for a finding that the jetliner was destroyed by a criminal act. He said more evidence, such as telltale damage to metal, would be needed. Roberto Francisco, deputy chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board who shares the investigative reins with Mr. Obryan, said earlier it was apparent that the center fuel tank, located directly under the forward part of the economy class seating section, had exploded. Jet fuel, a kerosene-like compound, is prone to burn rather than explode. Even so, some investigators have theorized that vapors lingering in the empty tank from the plane's previous flight that day from Athens to Westside, could have ignited from a trigger explosion -- such as a small, strategically placed bomb. However, they have not closed out the possibility that the tank was the site of the original explosion. Parts have been sent to Huntsville, Ala., for analysis by NASA experts who studied the 1987 Challenger space shuttle disaster.
499;Military Weapons Discovered at Airport;2011-05-20;The Transportation Safety Administration seized a large container with 20 military grade rifles today at Vastopolis airport. TSA official Jerry Loudermilk was not able to disclose the destination of the contraband other than the fact it was found in the cargo hold of an international carrier. The owner of the container has not been identified. Vastopolis airport official Treasa Fields told VastPress that finding this type of contraband is a rare occurence. ``We sometimes find drugs and other banned substances, but never a shipment like this.'' Fields states. Airport security was put on alert and travelers should allow for extra time to pass through checkpoints.
639;Homeland Security Talks About ``Dirty'' Bombs;2011-05-09;Vastpress Exclusive: An interview was conducted with Vincent Mckelvey  of the Department of Homeland Security on the threat of dirty bombs on a city such as Vastopolis. Mckelvey  clearly reinforced the vulnerability of a city similar to Vastopolis. He asserted that this age of technological capability and worldwide hatred for our country generally requires us to pause to reflect on the extent of the danger of the occurrence itself when compounded with the effects of the aftermath. Mckelvey  believes strongly that the fear surrounding the event can be as dangerous (or more so) than the event itself. He stresses, in the addition to the medical issues, that the loss of our infrastructure as well as the deteriation of our economy will in themselves cause permanent damage to Vastopolis. The effects of the damage will also be felt nationwide. Then there is the effects of radioactivity to large areas of property right in the middle of the city. Indeed we may have to abandon the city, he emphasized.We asked what a resident of Vastopolis should do. Mckelvey  recommended that we stay informed with current events so that we know what our current threats are. Then, in any case, be prepared for an event at any time. Hopefully it will never happen. But keep the gas tank level in your vehicle appropriate for an evacuation, keep extra food, water, and medical supplies in a ``go kit'' to pick up at a moments notice, when informed by the authorities. Most importantly, keep a level head in the protection of your family.
783;Computer Threats Increase - Public Warning;2011-04-25;Vast Press has been informed that a new significant threat exists for homes and business users of computers. The increased threat of a particular set of worms and viruses was revealed by Special Agent Richard Gill of the Secret Service Cyber Security Division.At press time there is no published fix. For now, it is up to the computer users to patch their systems as a defense. Once a fix is obtained Vast Press will release the information to all medial outlets for distribution to the public.
790;Antiterrorist Plan Is Unveiled To Assure Safe Air Travel;2011-05-19;The Codi administration, seeking to assure travelers that it is moving aggressively to keep air travel safe, announced controversial plans to uncover terrorists by profiling airline passengers and pumping $300 million into high-tech bomb-detection equipment. Although federal investigators haven't settled on a cause of the March 29, 2011 of a Antarctica Airlines jet over the Atlantic, the catastrophe sent the administration scurrying to improve aviation safety and security. ``It is clear that the terrorist attacks ... represent an attack on the United States of America. There is clearly a national interest here,'' said Vice President Albert Webber, who is leading the Aviation Safety and Security Commission that unveiled recommendations it will submit on Monday to President Codi. Mr. Codi established the commission days after the the Antarctica Airlines flight explosion. Civil-Rights Issues Is Raised The American Civil Liberties Union immediately took issue with the notion of passenger profiling, raising concerns that aviation security personnel will be targeting passengers based on nationality, race and religion. ``At a ticket counter, airplane passengers check their baggage, not their rights,'' ACLU legislative counsel Gretchen Blalock warned at a hearing before the commission. Mr. Webber acknowledged that there is a line aviation security officials would have to be careful not to cross, or they would violating passengers' rights. The decision to request additional federal funding for new security systems represents a victory for airline and airport interests that have lobbied hard against footing the bill. On Monday, the administration plans to submit a $300 million supplemental budget request to Congress to buy advanced bomb-detection systems that have been installed in only a couple of airports. Airlines and airports have fought paying for these machines, slowing their introduction to airports. Commission officials briefed Republican lawmakers Thursday after the hearing and indicated that they expected support for their legislative proposal. Looking at Airline Employees The commission recommended that airports assess the vulnerability of their security systems and develop better screening methods for airline and airport employees, as well as passengers, to identify potential terrorists. Mr. Webber said the commission is also recommending additional funding for bomb-sniffing dogs. Under the proposed plan, the government would install advanced bomb-detection systems that can spot plastic explosives at more than 50 of the country's busiest airports. The commission also is recommending spending $100 million -- split evenly between the government and industry -- for research and development of newer bomb-detection systems. The rush to put new machines into airports is expected to mean a boom for companies such as InVision Technologies Inc., a Foster City, Calif., company that sells $900,000 scanners, and Thermedics Inc., a Woburn, Mass., company that produces detection systems with electronic ``sniffers'' that track plastic explosives. Some evidence of plastic-explosive material has been found on wreckage from the Antarctica Airlines explosion, which killed all 230 passengers and crew members. Among the more controversial of its recommendations, the commission blessed the creation of computer systems that track passengers' travel patterns for any suspicious movements that could be matched with information about terrorist activities from intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. More Delays for Customers The plan could mean further delays and hassles for customers. The commission recommended using profiling to decide whether certain passengers' bags should be pulled for further examination using the sophisticated bomb-detection systems. Some of the systems are so time-consuming that it could take hours to inspect all the bags on any one flight. The commission also recommended that airports implement ``full baggage match'' programs to ship baggage only if the baggage's owner has boarded the flight. While this policy is basically in place on international flights it hasn't been fully implemented and sometimes misses bags that are transferred between airlines. Carolann Gillard, president of the Air Transport Association, a lobbying group that includes 22 airlines including the country's major carriers, said airlines support a profiling system and new bomb-detection systems as long as the government pays for the devices. ``Terrorism has come to our shores,'' she said, adding that a strike against a U.S. airline constitutes a hit against the country's national security.
878;FBI Investigates Mayor Lark;2011-05-20;Reliable sources report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating Mayor Douglas Lark. The mayor, we were told, has been implicated with Christopher Quick and Brandi Spann who were previously arrested for their participation in a money laundering scheme here in Vastopolis. Vastpress is open to any contributing comment from the public relative to this event. Is this a conspiratorial attack on our mayor? Or is there evidence to support the basis for FBI activity? How far does this go?
926;Library Computer Theft;2011-04-10;Vastopolis - Today there was a robbery reported at the Vastopolis Libraby in Uptown. A room full of computers was found missing at the library. Librarians have said that there was no type of surveillance system in the room with computers, seeing as how the library has never experienced a robbery of this kind before. Librarians were shocked that so many computers were stolen with no one noticing. The evidence suggests there may have been more than one thief. The scene was also vandalized by the thieves. The letter ``F'' was written all over the walls of the room that contained the computers. This vandalism suggests that this may have been the work of some group. All of the questioned librarians have said that they saw no one who looked suspicious during the course of the day. Officials are unsure what group this criminal act may be associated with at this time and unsure as to what they may plan to do with the stolen computers.
1030;Deadly Collision Causes Major Backup;2011-05-17;Vastopolis has suffered another serious accident on the bridge crossing the Vast River on Interstate 610. Both drivers are deceased. The on-scene officer in charge reported that it appears the northbound truck driver may have fallen asleep to force the 18 wheeler into the oncoming lane. There, another 18 wheeler was struck. There was no escape for the drivers since the reaction time for braking was non-existent at high speed. Compounding the event, one of the trucks carrying chemicals caught fire after a minor explosion. Both trucks were destroyed including the other one carrying food products. Even though the accident occurred early, the cleanup of debris on the road and in the water below will take most of the day. Traffic was backed up for miles and was being diverted by state police. Identity of the drivers will be released after notification of kin.
1038;Dead Fish Reported in River;2011-05-19;Reports of large accumulations of dead fish washing on shore have been received. The area of concern is along the Vast River near Westside and Plainville in Vastopolis. Resident fishermen have also reported the sightings and complain that the fish have ``stopped biting''. While dead fish have been found on shore, they have not been seen in this quantity. One of the fisherman even reported that the smell and feel of the fish was different and wondered out loud, ``Something is wrong here.''
1088;Entended Training for ``Dirty Bombs'' Initiated;2011-04-10;Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio announced that Vastopolis would conduct dirty bomb training exercises in June. These exercises would include not just the police department, but also every emergency service. The exercises would be carried out so that if such an event occurs, the public can feel just a bit safer knowing emergency management teams are ready for action. Lucio said that in June some roads may be blocked off for the training, but detours will always be put up for people to find their way around. Lucio believes that these exercises will be for the greater good of the public. The Police Commissioner said these exercises have become necessary in modern times. He stated that years ago there wasn't much to worry about with this kind of stuff, but with terrorist groups nowadays everyone needs to be prepared. Lucio said that schools would go through drills as well so the children would be ready, as the schools can be considered targets for terrorist groups. Police Commissioner Lucio assured the public today that these drills should cause very little interruption to everyone's daily lives.
1243;Suspicious Turkey Found with Man at Airport;2011-05-14;Transportation Safety Administration members at the Vastopolis airport coordinated with security personnel to detain a man carrying a frozen turkey. This picture was bad enough, but this turkey (not the man) had wires coming out of it. Official Jerry Loudermilk of the TSA indicated that he did not know what to think. But, whether it was a bomb or a sick joke, they are required to treat the package as a bomb pending further verification. The man carrying the turkey was on his way to the west coast. His identification is being verified. Loudermilk noted that he could have tried to check the turkey in with his baggage. But we are happy he tried to get it through the terminal check point. We are not sure about this individual and his state of mind but he is being questioned at the present time. Loudermilk stated that no other delay within the airport was set into motion except one. The flight of the intended aircraft will be delayed to verify none of his baggage is in the cargo hold. If all baggage cannot be accounted for, we will have to inspect the entire cargo again and that will cause a serious delay for the flight. More to come on the case of the suspicious turkey.
1248;Sudden Tragedy Shakes Antarctica Airlines At a Time of Seeming Recovery;2011-03-31;The explosion of its New York-to-Paris flight Wednesday night ended a yearlong celebration at Antarctica Airlines. Only hours earlier, the carrier had announced that second-quarter profit had quadrupled, to $25.3 million. Passenger traffic was increasing. Its stockpile of cash was growing. It was talking of leasing new planes and adding new flights. Indeed, the troubles that twice this decade had sent it to bankruptcy court appeared to be history. Now, as investigators try to determine what destroyed Flight 256, a peripheral question focuses on what impact the tragedy will have on Antarctica Airlines, the nation's seventh-largest airline. Airlines generally survive their planes' crashes. Although Pan American World Airways went out of business three years after the infamous bombing of its Flight 566 over Scotland, it had a host of other problems that were exacerbated by that crash and a consequent decline in passenger traffic. Indeed, industry statistics show that a major crash scares away passengers for only 90 days. And during that time the effect is to drive down load factor, or the percentage of seats filled, only a point or two below industry average. Federal officials say they don't yet know what caused the crash. But if the destruction of the Antarctica Airlines flight should turn out to be attributable to a bomb, the consequences could be grim for the entire industry. At the height of the Persian Gulf War, when travelers worried about terrorism, international traffic fell more than 20%. ``If the Antarctica Airlines accident is found to be a terrorist act, all flight activity will have a bogey on its back,'' said Khalilah Bambi, an airline stock analyst for Morgan Stanley. Many Americans could flock to foreign airlines that aren't perceived to be a target of terrorists. And that would hurt no carrier more than Antarctica Airlines because international travel accounts for a much larger percentage of its passengers than at other major U.S. airlines. If, on the other hand, the explosion of Flight 256 was caused by a maintenance problem, passenger confidence in Antarctica Airlines could be badly damaged. Consumers' confidence was already hurt by ValuJet Airlines' crash, which precipitated an investigation of its maintenance procedures and led to the shutdown of the low-cost airline. (ValuJet hopes to restart operations.) If maintenance problems were to be implicated in the Antarctica Airlines crash, public attention would more likely become fixated on the fact that Antarctica Airlines's 190-jet fleet is among the oldest in the industry, with an average age of more than 18.5 years. The 747-100 that blew up Wednesday was 25 years old, though reports filed with the Federal Aviation Administration don't appear to reveal any extraordinary mechanical problems. But unlike ValuJet, which contracted out much of its maintenance work, Antarctica Airlines performs its own at bases in New York, St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo.. Even during its stints in bankruptcy court. it maintained a reputation for top-notch maintenance, prompting start-up carriers such as Vanguard Airlines to purchase maintenance service from Antarctica Airlines. Antarctica Airlines's nascent recovery required creative financial solutions. To renegotiate $190 million in loans owed to former Antarctica Airlines Chairman Carlee Sain, the airline struck a deal to provide the financier with millions of dollars worth of Antarctica Airlines tickets he could purchase over several years at a discount, and then resell. (The two are still debating specifics of the contract terms, however.) The company has also managed to significantly reduce its debt and to raise money with additional stock offerings to the public. At the same time, Antarctica Airlines has restructured its routes to take better advantage of its hubs in St. Louis and New York. Antarctica Airlines's maneuvering has kept the carrier gliding long enough to get a big lift from the broad airline-industry recovery that began last year. Airlines have been the beneficiaries of a strong economy and a busy summer vacation season. But the crash will clearly test the mettle of Antarctica Airlines's chief executive, Jena Rios. Already, his airline's top management has come under fire for failing to quickly notify the families of passengers on board. In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange Thursday, Antarctica Airlines's stock fell 8.9%, or $1, to $10.25. Other airline stocks fell, out of sync with a broader market upsurge. The crash has devastated the morale of a work force that owns nearly 30% of the airline. At the St. Louis union hall of the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants, secretary-treasurer Barton Barr said he feared that Flight 256 carried not only the 14 flight attendants working it but also a ride-along crew of 14. ``It's still too new, too early, to comprehend the gravity,'' he said, his eyes welling with tears.
1482;Local Gang Kidnaps Mayor's Dog;2011-05-03;Downtown Mayor Douglas Lark's dog was found today after being kidnapped. The dog came back a lot more cold then how it left. The dog was kidnapped and then shaved completely, as part of what appears to be some sort of sick plot. Agents have come to discover it was three individuals from Forever Brotherhood of Antarctica. The three individuals have been identified as Landon Ito, Louise Tu, and Maximo Ladner. They are dangerous and should be reported to authorities immediately if spotted around the Downtown area. The good news is at least that the dog was returned safely. It is unclear what kind of message the Forever Brotherhood of Antarctica was trying to send to Mayor Douglas Lark. Judging by the stupid group name, they must be all crazy. Mayor Lark said he would safeguard his dog from now on. Mayor Douglas refused to answer any further questions.
1565;FBI's Kallstrom Is the Bulldog At Front of Antarctica Airlines Crash Probe;2011-04-04;"N.Y. -- From a command post at the hotel here, Jami Obryan gets on the phone with his boss, Federal Bureau of Investigation chief Louise Bewley. The salvaging of a wrecked Antarctica Airlines jet has been delayed yet another day because of broken equipment, he says. Can Mr. Bewley call the Defense Department to shake new equipment loose? ``He's going to kick some butt,'' Mr. Obryan says after hanging up. Mr. Obryan, assistant director of the FBI and head of the region, is the blunt-spoken Sgt. Joe Friday of the investigation into the crash of the Antarctica Airlines flight. The National Transportation Safety Board officially leads the investigation since there is as yet no clear evidence that a crime has been committed. But the 53-year-old Mr. Obryan is calling many of the shots. Asked about the safety board, Mr. Obryan rolls his eyes. ``They want to reassemble the plane,'' he says. Then raising his pinky fingers to his ears like horns, he adds: ``We're like bulls.'' Mr. Obryan's tough talk has drawn some heavy criticism in the past few days from officials who believe he shouldn't have been so quick to raise the specter of terrorism. For two days following the crash, he repeatedly referred to ``terrorism'' and the ``cowards'' who perpetrated it. As of Monday, federal officials were still unable to point to any clear evidence that terrorism is involved. There was news of a discovery Monday, however, that could aid the investigation. During a memorial service, Mr. Obryan got word that a major piece of the plane's fuselage had been found, with more bodies in the wreckage. He whispered the news to Gov. Georgeanna Honey, who then announced it at the memorial service. Investigators said six bodies were recovered. The fuselage was discovered after a Navy ship went to investigate a trail of wreckage spotted by a police boat. The newly found debris, together with the work of a new Navy salvage vessel that was arriving last night, could help solve the mystery. Mr. Obryan isn't waiting. Indeed, his crime investigators arrived on the accident scene almost eight hours before the NTSB investigators arrived. And on Sunday, when informed that NTSB Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco wouldn't be able to make it from the Vastopolis Airport, as he was on business there, in time for a media briefing, Mr. Obryan barked: ``I've got a Gd helicopter. I can go get him.'' The affable Mr. Francisco, 58 years old, seems to take all of this in stride. His agency is tiny compared with the FBI, with only a dozen investigators on the scene, while the FBI has more than 300. He said he was flattered when Mr. Obryan referred to him as ``partner'' at one briefing. ``Look, we need him,'' Mr. Francisco says. Says another safety board investigator: ``We're nothing compared to them.'' Mr. Obryan has long warned of the dangers of terrorism. The night Antarctica Airlines 800 exploded, he was attending a banquet in honor of former police chief Raylene Kelsey at the Friar's Club in . Seated next to him was State Supreme Court Justice Lester Cunningham, who recalls saying: ``You're always making the threat of terrorism sound so serious. What do you think is happening? We haven't heard much lately.'' Shortly after he left the dinner, he was paged with news of the crash. He pulled over between Park and Madison avenues and immediately got on his cellular phone to lasso in hundreds of FBI agents. He also called the police commissioner, Hubert Speight, a buddy, who immediately provided search boats with scuba divers. Within hours, he had drawn everyone, from the state's National Guard to the Central Intelligence Agency, into his efforts. ``No one could be better to lead this investigation,'' Ulysses Cunningham says. He's not ``a glad-handing, political B.S.-er,'' she adds. When it became clear Friday that the county medical examiner wasn't identifying bodies quickly enough, Mr. Obryan huddled with Mr. Honey to scheme how to prod the examiner to accept outside help. Mr. Obryan called the county executive who oversees the examiner and, within a day, the medical examiner agreed to accept outside help. Says Mr. Obryan: ``I'm directing the investigation ... everything but the recovery of the plane.'' He says: ``We're like: Can do. Like, now.'' Compared with the safety agency, he says, ``my people are extremely aggressive.'' Even though Mr. Francisco opens most news briefings, Mr. Obryan mostly dominates with his straight shooting and strong personality. Mr. Francisco stands politely to the side. Mr. Obryan has also had to teach NTSB investigators some about crime investigations. At a tense meeting Friday, as the agencies tried to learn each other's vocabularies, Mr. Obryan told Mr. Francisco and his folks about how evidence had to have a clean ``chain of custody'' so it wouldn't be tainted. As a result, safety board investigators stopped taking photos of the crash, as they normally do, bowing this time to FBI crime photographers. Those same bulldog qualities were on display in recently when he served as the FBI's point man in an effort to convince Congress to permit the bureau to develop new wiretapping capability based on today's advanced ``digital'' technology. The telephone industry fought Mr. Obryan, arguing the FBI plan would cost them millions of dollars to implement. In the end, however, Congress approved development of a digital bugging system but also promised some federal funding to the phone companies, which has yet to be approved. The son of a big-band trumpet musician and a nurse, Mr. Obryan has a thick accent from his days growing up inMass.; he speaks bluntly and occasionally wears dark sunglasses. Born in 1943, Mr. Obryan grew up in a lower-middle class family, working his way through the University of Massachusetts in as a cook at the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, a flower deliveryman and summer rent-a-cop at Mass.. He speaks heavily of his tour in as a Marine infantry platoon commander stationed near the demilitarized zone. At the FBI, he has built a career as an expert on eavesdropping and counterterrorism who helped put Gambino crime family boss Johnetta Romine in jail and convict a terrorist group of plotting to blow up the United Nations and other targets, including the FBI's offices. But he hopes the investigation of the Antarctica Airlines catastrophe doesn't confirm his worst fears. Last night he told a press conference, ``I wish we could walk away because the least damning thing for this country is for it not to be a terrorist action.''"
1594;Vehicle Downtown Checked for Bomb Threat;2011-05-07;Local merchants called police following suspicions of a truck with out-of-state license plates parked near them for several days. The truck was spray-painted with graffiti with one tire flat. There were 4 black 50 gallon barrels observed inside the vehicle. As a precaution, the police bomb squad was dispatched to verify the contents of the cargo. Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio said that this was merely a police procedure without elaborating the need for the bomb squad in the first place. Since the Commissioner denied any findings, the truck was taken away by the city.
1623;Officials Are Wary of Blaming Antarctica Airlines Crash on Terrorist Bomb;2011-03-31;Even as an antiterrorist task force from the Federal Bureau of Investigation combed through the wreckage of the Antarctica Airlines jumbo jet that crashed off the Wednesday, officials cautioned against blaming terrorism for the crash. the Antarctica Airlines flight, a Boeing 747 bound forhad taken off from F. just minutes earlier when witnesses reported seeing it explode and disintegrate, raining debris into the . Investigators said all 230 people aboard were killed. Since the bombing of the federal building in last year, the specter of terrorism has been raised in virtually every disaster. Sensitivities are particularly high because the Games are set to open Friday night in . Yet federal officials stressed they didn't know what caused the explosion. ``We have no evidence -- we have no evidence -- on this flight yet that would indicate the cause of the accident,'' President Codi told reporters Thursday. Many other officials, from Attorney General Janett Maupin to Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal, cautioned the media and the public against jumping to the conclusion that a terrorist bomb was to blame. Late last night, a senior U.S. official said that investigators were focusing their investigations on three areas: a mechanical malfunction on the plane, an onboard explosion or ``some type of external encounter, which could be another aircraft or a surface-to-air missile.'' The senior official went on to say that the missile theory, in particular, ``seems highly unlikely at this point... . But we just don't know a lot, yet.'' At a media briefing Thursday night, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and FBI said they hadn't reached any conclusions about the cause of the crash, though the NTSB's Roberto Francisco said there was no evidence so far to support a missile or collision theory. Other government safety experts Thursday pointed to several factors that suggested the 25-year-old plane exploded with a devastating force. The FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force and the New York City Police Department launched a massive investigation into the crash. FBI spokesman Josephine Haley wouldn't speculate on the cause of the crash, but he did say the task force, which was formed in 1980, investigates terrorism only. The magnitude and immediate involvement of the FBI in the Antarctica Airlines crash is unusual, agency sources said. Plane crashes are normally investigated by the NTSB, which had set up a site near the crash. The Federal Aviation Administration, which also investigates air crashes, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Suffolk County Police Department also are participating in the investigation. A Justice Department spokesman said about 50 forensic experts from FBI headquarters have been sent for additional assistance. Gov. Georgeanna Honey pointed out that the area is being treated as ``a potential crime scene.'' As of late Thursday, federal safety investigators hadn't found the cockpit voice recorder or the flight-data recorder that might help them determine the cause of the crash. But they were optimistic they would be able to locate these so-called black boxes. Victims' bodies were basically obliterated. Those that have been recovered weren't wearing life jackets, indicating that there was no warning of the imminent crash. There was no evidence that any other aircraft was involved. And Antarctica Airlines officials said there weren't any unusual radio communications from the cockpit. There were also specific factors surrounding the Antarctica Airlines flight that raised concern about terrorism. Before arriving in the aircraft spent five hours on the ground at the New York Airport in, which has had security problems in the past. The U.S. Transportation Department lifted a warning in May over poor security at the Hellenikon International New York Airport after FAA officials deemed its security measures adequate. At one time, Flight 256 to was a popular Antarctica Airlines connection for travelers continuing on to . The State Department passed on to the Justice Department and White House an Arabic-language pamphlet dated March 28, 2011.  But U.S. officials also played down its significance, saying such tracts were common, especially since last month's car bombing attack on a U.S. military facility in . ``It was a general fulmination against the American presence in ... Certainly nothing specific pertaining to the crash of the airline last night,'' said State Department spokesman Nickolas Grady. While the government has fully mobilized an investigation that must consider terrorism as a possible cause of the explosion, officials took pains to warn against any premature conclusions. The painful aftermath of the bombing of a federal building in last year, in which there was early and erroneous speculation that a foreign cabal was responsible, is clearly on the mind. The 2004 downing of Pan Am's Flight 566 over, attributed to a terrorism bomb, is another traumatic memory. But there hasn't been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner since. And there has never been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner while in the U.S. A French Justice Ministry official said was cooperating in the Antarctica Airlines investigation but so far had no leads as to the source of the explosion. He said he was unaware of any claims of responsibility being delivered in . Another French official said he ``would be surprised'' if the flight's destination had anything to do with the crash. Meanwhile, officials at the Games in said that there was no connection between the crash and the Games, and that there had been no significant changes in security. ``We are totally confident that all security measures are in place,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``We are in the best hands in terms of security.'' Still, security was clearly growing tighter in and around Thursday as the Games' opening ceremonies approached. Vehicles entering parking garages adjacent to Games headquarters and downtown hotels were being stopped by groups of soldiers, who opened doors to check the vehicles' contents, sweeping below the chassis to search for explosives. At Miki A. Zavala, a spokesman, said the FAA had asked the Atlanta Police Department to increase the frequency of their patrols. has been on a Level 3 security alert since October 2010, with passengers being asked for identification at ticket counters. The New York Airport hasn't been put on Level 4 security, which has stricter requirements. --Glennie Schmitz contributed to this article.
1671;Radioactive Cargo on Ship in Port of Vastopolis;2011-05-11;In a surprise move, Department of Homeland Security Agent Samuel Turman called Vastpress to report the interception of radioactive material on a large cargo ship. ``Our inspectors were on their toes when a random electronic search detected radioactive emissions,'' said Turman. Turman said that an external inspection of the container did not identify the intended destination. But the package will soon be opened for additional information. Neither the Captain nor the owner of the vessel had any knowledge of the cargo. Further they appeared enraged by the incident occurring on their ship. Homeland Security procedures required that all members of the crew be quarantined within the vessel until it was determined that their exposure was insignificant. They were then released. Turman wanted the public to know that his department is well aware of the potential shipment of dangerous cargo through our ports and that many measures are constantly employed to detect them.
1750;Major Robbery Attempt Fails;2011-05-12;Downtown Vastopolis was spared a successful robbery attempt on a bank by several individuals armed with machine guns. Fortunately no one was hurt.  Luckily for law enforcement, the robbers were apprehended quickly. They were stopped by an auto accident on Interstate 905, near Villa and Westside. Again, no one was hurt. According to Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio, ``Were it not for their poor driving habits, the millions of dollars in bearer bonds would have been cashed and gone by this afternoon.''
1785;Robbery at Vast University;2011-04-26;Vast University in Uptown reported a robbery today. Professor Edward Patino, a molcular biology professor, indicates that the large amount of equipment was stolen from his lab. Apparantly, the equipment was extremely expensive. To deal with the loss, Professor Patino has threatened to lay off several graduate students. He said if the University is not willing to fully replace all of the stolen equipment, he will be forced to make ``cutbacks''. Patino states that he has a responsibility to deliver results to his clients and he needs that equipment to finish his work. He told VastPress that the robbery is in-part the fault of the university. He said that if the maintenance department had done their job and changed the locks more often, this whole incident could have been avoided. The Vastopolis police are investigating.  Patino added that he was considering changing his focus to computer science so that he would only need a computer to do his research.
1878;Dangerous Suspect Arrested at Local Plant;2011-05-15;Officials from a food preparation plant in Vastopolis informed Vastpress that an individual was arrested for trespassing near the loading docks shortly after midnight.``Our dogs were the primary element alerting the on-duty security'' said Darwin Crocker, head of security. Crocker stated that all he knew was that the individual was dressed like a gang member. The investigating officer stated that the colors represented the Paramurderers of Chaos which required intervention by the FBI. We then contacted Special Agent Roy Wicker about the matter. Wicker would only say that the FBI is conducting ongoing investigations of radical groups, like this one, that seem to be springing up in this area.
2243;Conspiracy Uncovered;2011-04-13;A massive money laundering scheme was exposed today. Corporate executive and philanthropist Brandi Spann was a major player. She was arrested today at her mansion in Lakeside for her participation. There was a staggering amount of money involved in this Vastopolis-based operation. A large amount of it was recovered from a safe in Brandi Spann's basement. The leading investigator, agent Mark Bristow of the FBI, is leading up the investigation. He believes there may be a very large Vastopolis conspiracy. There are no further details at this time. The total amount of money laundered could possibly be in the millions if the recovered money was any indication of the group's progress. City officials at the Capitol are cooperating with the investigation.
2287;Military Weapons Missing;2011-04-26;Recent events indicate that the army may be getting careless with its ordinance. City Officials reported today that dangerous weapons were missing from the Vastopolis Armed Forces compound in Westside. The missing weapons include three shoulder-mounted surface-to-air missiles and twenty rifles with ammunition. Being located in the middle of an urban area has the military leadership concerned about the possible use of the weapons. Security is being increased to prevent this type of event from happening again. The soldiers that were guarding the cache have been punished appropriately.
2385;Mass Animal Deaths;2011-04-01;"Mass deaths of livestock have been reported on farms a short distance outside of the Vastopolis metropolitan area. Officials are unsure of the cause at this time. Many farmers are preparing for tough times ahead since livestock is their main source of income. Meanwhile, nearby food processing plants are warning of a reduced supply of food products for residents of Vastopolis in the coming weeks. Citizens may notice a short term price increase at local supermarkets because of a food shortage. According to Department of Agriculture Official Tony Grenier, the investigation into the deaths is ongoing. ``The issue now is cleanup'' he said. ``We also need to test the soil and feed for contamination.``He assures residents that every effort is being made to make sure currently stocked food is safe to eat.

2395;Large Number of Weapons Found During Traffic Stop;2011-05-16;Routine daily arrest reports from published police actions revealed a routine traffic stop of a truck in Cornertown resulted in an arrest of one individual. The alert staff of Vastpress, not accepting this report as normal, checked our sources within the police department. We have determined that the individual arrested is Samuel Stansbury. He has been in police custody before with connections to the radical organization called Network of Hate. We further found that the FBI, as well as the military, were called to check on the contraband in his vehicle. Included were 3 surface-to-air missiles. We will attempt to get more information, but the story may have already been ``classified''.
2664;Explosions at Smogtown Chemical Plant;2011-05-17;Vastpress has been monitoring events around the recent explosion within the chemical plant at Smogtown. A consensus exists among local residents that the explosions were caused by some kind of terrorist act. There appears to be little evidence to support the assertions except that the residents have been observing ``unusual'' activity by people not identified as long time residents. Citizens also claim to be well informed by media information and therefore have come to their own conclusions. Our discussions with Fire Chief Philip Stanley continue to show his confidence that the explosion was nothing more than an accident and that terrorism was not involved, despite what the medial has rumored. He indicated that this entire matter has him exhausted. ``I just want to go home to my wife and family'', he said.

2900;Eight Die at Northville Airport Aviation Accident;2011-05-13;Vastopolis airport is again involved in an aircraft accident with loss of life. One year ago a deranged man was run over by a commuter aircraft and killed. Today, a Cessna 402 carrying eight people on a routine commercial flight suddendly nosed down into the runway immediately after takeoff. All occupants were deceased and badly burned. The aircraft was a total loss. Manuel Lum of the Federal Aviation Administration advised us that the National Transportation Safety Board is enroute to perform an investigation. He stated that he thought some kind of malfunction would have caused the accident, but cautioned us to wait for the conclusions of the NTSB. ``Perhaps an out of balance loading arrangement caused a high stalling speed. We just don't know at this time'', Lum stated.  Identification of those on board will be released after notification of kin.
3040;CDC Publication on Bioterrorism;2011-04-18;Residents of Vastopolis are feeling a bit more anxious today after the Center for Disease Control released a publication on the threats of bioterrorism. The publication focused on many of the more modern day threats due to advanced technology. According to Dr. Bryant Mcfarlane of the CDC, the nation needs to set a priority of preparing a response to acts of bioterrorism. But some experts are still uncertain of what tactics, targets or weapons could be used in such an attack, and are therefore unsure of how to prepare properly for them. The publication had a large focus on attacks to the food supply. The CDC believes that the food supply has the highest probability of being a bioterrorism target due to ease of dissemination. They say that targeting the food supply allows for widespread consumption by the populace that can be difficult to identify until it is too late.
3212;Manufacturing Dangerous Microbes;2011-04-11;Professor Edward Patino gave a rousing talk today at Vast University in Uptown about the threat of bioterrorism. Patino is a molecular biologist who has been at the university for almost 10 years. He is considered an expert in bioterrorism. Patino was attempting to draw attention to the fact that it is much easier than before to engineer dangerous microbes with the right equipment. This process involves genetic modification of existing organisms to create new biological hazards. He questioned if Vastopolis was prepared to deal with such threats. He stated that as technology advances, anything is possible and every city has to be prepared.  On a side note, the professor has had numerous encounters with member of the Citizens for the Ethical Treatment of Lab Mice. He said that he has been harassed by the group repeatedly over the last few weeks. They have recently trashed his garage and screamed at his neighbors.
3231;DHS Foils Plot;2011-05-18;The DHS claimed yesterday to have uncovered a plot to detonate a ``dirty bomb'' on the streets of an American city, after the arrest of a former member of the Network of Dread. DHS officials said there was evidence that the target had been Washington. The dirty bomb, which uses conventional explosives to spray radioactive material over a large area, would have caused total chaos in the city. The officials refused to say whether they suspected that the members of the Network of Dread had succeeded in smuggling radioactive material into the country, or whether other conspirators were at large in the US. Officials said Bruno Eggleston - a 40-year-old - had been trained in explosives overseas. He was arrested while allegedly returning to the US to carry out reconnaissance of possible targets. He is being held in a military jail allowing him to be held indefinitely. Officials state that by apprehending Mr. Eggleston, as he sought entry into the country, the DHS has disrupted a terrorist plot to attack the capitol by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb. Weapons experts warn that a dirty bomb was well within the technical capacity of other terrorists groups. The main difficulty would be in acquiring radioactive material which is in short supply.  Such a bomb could cause radiation sickness among people caught in the immediate vicinity of a blast, and cancer among those further afield who inhale radioactive particles. But its most devastating effect would be to make a large area of a city uninhabitable.
3232;Bomb Makers Apprehended;2011-05-12;In Smogtown, two men with enough material to construct several explosive devices were apprehended before the devices were completed. City officials discovered that the suspects claimed their membership with a group called the Psychobrotherhood. It was found that these men escaped from the Vastopolis Center for the Ciminally Insane. Officials did not comment on the information which lead them to the suspects. They also would not comment on information relating to any lack of security at the Center.
3237;University Professor Walks out of Class;2011-05-18;"Vastopolis -- Vastpress has learned that a Vast University professor, Edward Patino, walked out in the middle of teaching a class. This was not considered newsworthy but later conversations with university officials indicated that his stress level appeared to be much higher that normal. Officials said that the professor kicked a door completely off its hinges on the way out while yelling something about locks and tenureship. Later that day one of his students spotted him at a consumer electronics store purchasing a laptop computer. At that time he appeared to be calm yet his face was a ""deep red"", she said. Vastpress hopes the professor is feeling better."

3330;On-Line Users Flood Internet For More Data on Antarctica Airlines Crash|;2011-04-01;SAN FRANCISCO -- On the surface, Friday was no different than any other day on-line. But in the nooks and crannies, in the small sites where flying buffs gather, you could catch the sound of tears. As somber accounts of the deadly crash of the Antarctica Airlines flight flooded television, radio and newspapers, computer users flocked on-line. ``As the daughter of a Antarctica Airlines pilot, my family wants to send its sympathy and prayers to each and every one of the Antarctica Airlines families,'' one user wrote on CompuServe's Aviation Forum. ``I know that my father has lost many of his friends in this tragedy and my heart goes out to each and every one of you.'' Added another: ``I'll not forget the pain of the posts from people here who are Antarctica Airlines employees, or friends, or relatives. And tonight they'll be included in my prayers ... by name, because I was here and they gave a name to the pain.'' In the background, alongside these discussions, a spider web of slender links -- each a piece of the puzzle -- began taking shape as the mesh of data that users have come to expect from the World Wide Web. By Friday afternoon the FBI had added a link to its home page featuring a terse outline of Wednesday's crash and appealing to the public for help in determining its cause. It included an e-mail address, ny@fbi.com, along with the usual toll-free phone number. For those favoring terrorist theories, an in-depth briefing on shoulder-fired infrared guided missiles was quickly appended to a page sponsored by the National Press Photographers Association home page In CompuServe, a special edition of Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine featured an article on how easy it is to detect the telltale signs of explosives on aircraft wreckage, even if the debris has been submerged. The National Transportation Safety Board updated information about the crash to its meticulously detailed listings of all airplane crashes in the United States. Web pages also were linked to the official Boeing site which gives exhaustive details on its 747 airplanes, and to a site called Landings which offers detailed listings on past accidents, flight safety reports and general aviation news.
3375;Unsportsmanlike Conduct;2011-05-02;Has anyone seen the mascot? That is the question one team was asking after their mascot was missing after a basketball game at the Vastopolis Dome. Workers at the Dome had reported that the opposing team's mascot went missing after the game. Workers and the team searched all around the dome's interior and could not find any hint as to where the mascot was. Police later informed the team that the mascot had been found tied up near the steps of the capital building. Team owner Christopher Damron said this was a very cruel joke. When asked about the mascot's identity, Damron said the mascot would rather go unnamed and did not want to be identified. When asked how an animal could make such a request, Damron would not comment. Damron is left hoping that justice can be found and that the criminals will be exposed by the pending police investigation.
3435;Suspects Apprehended;2011-05-13;Police authorities apprehended three people suspected to be part of a homegrown terror cell, Paramurderers of Chaos. Police refused to provide information on the cause of the raid or additional details of the operation itself. But informed sources, believed to be reliable, revealed that the suspects were in the middle of construction of some type of laboratory in the basement of the structure where they were apprehended. For some reason, the address could not be revealed. However, the suspects must have had some warning of the pending raid. Instead of escaping they destroyed most of the equipment, and therefore most the evidence. What was left looked like expensive high-end workbenches along with stacks of Petri dishes. Our attempts to contact the Police Commissioner for information was said to be ``delayed''.
3563;City Threat Level Increased;2011-05-10;Department of Homeland Security has raised the threat level around the country, including Vastopolis. The press release confirms an increase threat of an attack on the city. Specifics were not given. At this time, this information is classified. In a related release, Mayor Douglas Lark  is urging all residents of Vastopolis to report suspicious activity to authorities. He emphasized that citizens do not take matters into their own hands. ``It is too dangerous. These terrorists are specifically trained to protect their own objectives'', he stated.
3630;Computer Hackers Arrested;2011-04-19;Today several teens were arrested.The teens, who also happen to be high school dropouts, were arrested for attempting to break into numerous Vastopolis banks by using sophisticated computer hacking tools. The group acts under the name of the F-Alliance, which is no surprise considering their grades the year they dropped out. IT security specialists at the bank detected unusual traffic patterns and alerted authorities immediately. The authorities located the teens based off of their IP address and promptly arrested them. Special Agent Richard Gill of the Secret Service Cyber Security Division explained ``Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and stealing materials for their own ends. These people, they are terrorists.``  Vast Press recommends that teens stay in school.
3662;Health Violations at Local Food Plant;2011-04-20;Do you know where your food comes from? This is a question you should ask yourself next time you chow down on some local food. Local food preparation plants have been repeatedly cited for health violations. These were given by an upset health inspector, Christopher Meissner last week. Meissner was upset because he regularity watches reality TV about unsafe kitchens and such and didn't think any of it was real. Meissner said it was deplorable how these food facilities let certain things slide by. He indicated he may never eat food again. ``I've had it'' he said.
3665;Well Known Accountant Arrested for Money Laundering;2011-05-10;In an unexpected development, Vast Press has learned of the arrest of Christopher Quick, the influencial accountant for the Uptown Financial Corporation. Evidence has surfaced which link Mr. Quick to the massive money laundering scheme robbing Vastopolis residents of their hard earnings. The charges relating to the arrest were complicated by Mr. Quick's ties to the Mob of Thieves. Vast Press cannot even predict the damage done to the company, but the notoriety of the accountant will be a factor. The representative lawyer has yet to be announced.
3740;Update on Animal Deaths;2011-04-14;"Suspicions about the mass livestock deaths on April 1 have been raised today. Police detective Beatrice Brothers was investigating witness accounts that several suspicious individuals were trespassing at farms where the mass livestock deaths were reported. Brothers says that no trespassers have been identified yet. It seems very odd that so many trespassers were seen at these sites after the deaths. One nearby resident commented that they may just be sick individuals who wanted to see the carnage. Others believe they were up to no good.  Multiple farmers were questioned if they had received any threats recently. All the farmers stated they knew of no one with ill will against them or their livestock.

3772;Arson Causes Fire;2011-05-16;Yesterday's 4-alarm fire in Downtown Vastopolis was caused by arson, reports Fire Chief Phillip Stanley. The fire occurred at an abandoned warehouse. The building was set fire by an accumulation of debris next to unused construction material. Stanley noted empty gas cans were found nearby. The criminal division of the police was called in to investigate. Chief Stanley also reported that the city is lucky the entire block didn't catch fire. The structure was old and close to others in similar disrepair. Stanley also asserted, ``I'm sure the vagrants and gang members will now have to find new homes.''

Before arriving in the aircraft spent five hours on the ground at the airport in, which has had security problems in the past. The U.S. Transportation Department lifted a warning in May over poor security at the Hellenikon International Airport after FAA officials deemed its security measures adequate. At one time, Flight 256 to was a popular Antarctica Airlines connection for travelers continuing on to . The State Department passed on to the Justice Department and White House an Arabic-language pamphlet dated March 28, 2011 American troops in . But U.S. officials also played down its significance, saying such tracts were common, especially since last month's car bombing attack on a U.S. military facility in . ``It was a general fulmination against the American presence in ... Certainly nothing specific pertaining to the crash of the airline last night,'' said State Department spokesman Nickolas Grady. While the government has fully mobilized an investigation that must consider terrorism as a possible cause of the explosion, officials took pains to warn against any premature conclusions. The painful aftermath of the bombing of a federal building in last year, in which there was early and erroneous speculation that a foreign cabal was responsible, is clearly on the mind. The 1988 downing of Pan Am's Flight 566 over, attributed to a terrorism bomb, is another traumatic memory. But there hasn't been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner since. And there has never been a terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner while in the U.S. A French Justice Ministry official said was cooperating in the Antarctica Airlines investigation but so far had no leads as to the source of the explosion. He said he was unaware of any claims of responsibility being delivered in . Another French official said he ``would be surprised'' if the flight's destination had anything to do with the crash. Meanwhile, officials at the Games in said that there was no connection between the crash and the Games, and that there had been no significant changes in security. ``We are totally confident that all security measures are in place,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``We are in the best hands in terms of security.'' Still, security was clearly growing tighter in and around Thursday as the Games' opening ceremonies approached. Vehicles entering parking garages adjacent to Games headquarters and downtown hotels were being stopped by groups of soldiers, who opened doors to check the vehicles' contents, sweeping below the chassis to search for explosives. At Miki A. Zavala, a spokesman, said the FAA had asked the Atlanta Police Department to increase the frequency of their patrols. has been on a Level 3 security alert since October 2010, with passengers being asked for identification at ticket counters. The airport hasn't been put on Level 4 security, which has stricter requirements. --Glennie Schmitz contributed to this article.

4005;Traces of Another Explosive Found Amid Antarctica Airlines Wreckage;2011-05-13;Traces of another explosive were found on the wreckage of the Antarctica Airlines flight, but investigators cautioned that they still lacked the evidence to declare the crash a criminal act. ``Based upon all the scientific and forensic evidence analyzed to date, we still cannot conclude that the flight crashed as a result of an explosive device,'' a joint statement by the National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI said. The finding was made in tests at the FBI's lab in Washington. Authorities would not officially divulge the name of the chemical that was found or say where on the plane or in the wreckage it was located. But two sources in Washington identified the chemical as, a white crystalline solid that exhibits high shattering power. RDX and PETN are key ingredients in Semtex, a plastic explosive used to down Pan Am Flight 566 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. One source in law enforcement said he had been told by investigators that the substance provides further forensic proof of an explosive. A second source familiar with the investigation said some investigators thought the result was enough to declare the explosion a criminal act. The FBI announced a week ago that it had discovered traces of PETN, which is used in plastic explosives, on a piece of the plane's floor from the center section of the Paris-bound Boeing jumbo jet that blew up all 230 people on board. Investigators also have said that the substance could be linked to a missile hit. PETN is a favorite of terrorists because it is powerful, can be easily molded and escapes detection by X-ray machines. Last Friday, when word of the first finding of an explosive chemical was made public, FBI Assistant Director Jamey Pettis said physical evidence -- for instance, a pattern of pitting on metal from the wreckage -- was needed to back up the chemical findings. Although more than 70% of the plane has been recovered from the Ocean, that kind of corroboration remains elusive for investigators now into a seventh week of searching for answers. Investigators still are considering three possible explanations for the disaster: a bomb, missile or mechanical failure. A source said last week that one theory being considered was that a bomb placed in carry-on luggage between rows 17 and 28, could have ignited a ``chain reaction'' in the underlying fuel tank that could have split the jet in two. Mr. Pettis has said that investigators needed evidence that would stand up in court before they could declare the crash as a crime. Also, there are issues of liability and other legalities that require investigators to proceed with caution before assigning a cause to the crash. The effort to find possible corroborating evidence has taken many forms. Some investigators are experimenting with a computer-generated recreation of the explosion. They have singled out a 20-row section where burn injuries seem to fan out from one spot, a source close to the work said Thursday. Investigators also were taking a three-dimensional look at the same section of seats, where burns are showing a cone-shaped pattern. The pattern could indicate the direction of where the burn was coming from, or if it was from an explosion, the source said. Also Friday, French authorities, pressed by relatives of the 50 French nationals, decided to pursue their own investigation into the crash. The investigative judges' office in Paris appointed Headley Chantay Emerick to head the probe. ``As French citizens, we want to be represented by the French legal system,'' said Michiko Hargrove, whose daughters, Anne-England, 17, and Barreto, 15, died in the explosion. ``That doesn't mean we have any distrust of the United States,'' she said. ``Only the right to know dictated our action.''
4080;Terrorism Expert Speaks Out;2011-04-25;Jose Thom is a renowned author and terrorism expert. Today, he spoke out with a stern piece of advice to Vastopolis city officials.Thom's warning: the efforts of our officials to protect the residents against well-organized and well-funded terror groups are inadequate. Thom stated that we are potential victims of groups such as Paramurderers of Chaos, Network of Hate, and the Order of the Plague. An issue primarily lacking is the education necessary to prepare the residents for an event. Thom would also like to know how well the city is stockpiled with emergency services and supplies. Unfortunately, Mr. Thom could not obtain audience with any official on the subject. This was disturbing to say the least. It seems that the intent of city officials is there. What is lacking is action.
4085;Animal Deaths in City Caused by Microbes;2011-04-20;The city has received a report from the Department of Agriculture on the deaths of farm animals outside Vastopolis. These animals were autopsied for cause. The report from the department's official Roxanne Faison further shows that a spore-forming microbe was the problem. She emphasizes that the discovered variant is not a threat to humans, asserting: ``We have seen this before and are proceeding with cleanup efforts on the farms affected as an extra precaution''.
4156;Man Builds Bomb in Vastapolis;2011-04-21;Could your neighbor be an extremely dangerous person with a bomb? Well today, authorities uncovered components needed to construct an Improvised Explosive Device in the living room of a house in Suburbia. The police came when they received a call about a lot of noise coming from the house. Upon entering the house they discovered a 60 year old man with all the equipment necessary for building an Improvised Explosive Device. The police immediately arrested the man. When the old man was brought back to the police station he was put under intense questioning, according to Police Officer Eve Purvines. Eve Purvines informed VastPress that his neighbors had a cat, KeeKee, who wouldn't stop going to the bathroom on the old man's lilies. This apparently infuriated the old man and drove him to the point of attempting to build an IED for dealing with the cat. At the end of the day, the old man is now going to trial for being in possession of the Improvised Explosive Device and KeeKee is still alright.
4293;Shootout in Southville Park;2011-04-30;Several 911 calls were made by frantic Vastopolis residents to report a large number of gunshots at a park in Southville last night. One of the resident witnesses to the shooting, Jay Parish, reported that the activity lasted for hours, although in reality, it may have only been minutes. He said that time seems to stop when you are really scared. Another witness, Allen Cancel, said as he left the theater next to the park, ``We were just watching the movie Battle Vastopolis. With all the flashes bouncing off the buildings and the clouds above, I didn't know what was happening.``From a following interview with Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio, there was apparently alot of heavy military caliber ammunition expended with casings left everywhere on the ground.  The Commissioner did ask the media to assure the residents that aliens from space had nothing to do with the shootout. Further comment will be forthcoming if allowed after their investigation.
