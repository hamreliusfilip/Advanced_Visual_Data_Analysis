To run the HTML pages you need a enviorment, we recommend a local server trough the extension "Live Server" within Visual studio code. Start on "index.html" and navigate trough the visualizations from there. 

To run this, no python scripts need to be compiled - all data neccesary is already done and nested wihtin the project.

If one were to run the python scripts, the large data from the VAST challange of 2020 MC1 needs to be downloaded as its to large to upload within the project (6.35 GB). This should be placed within the "Data" folder, from there everything will work without changes. The file to download is named "CGCS-GraphData.CSV". 

The data can be accessed here:
